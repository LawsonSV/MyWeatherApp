# MyWeatherApp

    This is my weather dashboard, I created it by making a call to the openweathermap geocoding api to allow the user to search a city by name and have that return me longitudinal and latitudinal values. I then make a call to the openweathermap one call api to input those lon/lat values and have all the weather data returned to me. I then created elements that I would append the necessary data to via element.textContent. I  also created a series of if/else statements to add one of three classes to the UV index element depending on its value. Then in CSS I added colors to each of those classes accordingly. I styled my dashboard with a mixture of Bootstrap styling and my own personal CSS styling. The part I struggled with was getting the search history box to work. As it is currently it only stores one value. At some point in the future, once I'm caught up on some other homework assignments, I plan to return to this assignment to try to figure out the search history box.
